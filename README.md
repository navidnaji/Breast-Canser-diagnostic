Breast Cancer diagnostic
explore the Breast Cancer Winsconsin diagnostic dataset, which is made of 596 instances of 30 input features obtained from real cell measurements 
like (radius, mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, etc). 
The goal is to predict whether each instance is a tumor cell or a normal cell.
